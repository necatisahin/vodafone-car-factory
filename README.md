# Vodafone Car Factory!


In this problem, you are given an interface Car. There are three classes Cabrio, Sedan and Hatchback which implement
the Car interface, and they all contain a method getType().
interface Car {
public String getType();
}
Create a spring boot project and then, publish a rest controller. Your controller method returns sample output by given
input.
